# AmiStick product page

This is an archival product page for a custom arcade stick, designed, and made by myself, for use with Amiga computers, and a few other retro systems.

Keep in mind, that this project is currently dead. You can still play with the configuration script, and the e-mail address for submitting product enquiries is also active, but I'm not taking orders anymore.

If you have a business, or design question regarding the project, feel free to use the address mentioned before.
